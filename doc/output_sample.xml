             @single = "true|false[=default]"; default is false if
                 @single not provided; this one's tricky; single
                 means that the leaf was always single;

              Examples:

              1. If a leaf is or was part of a conjoin, @single is
                 "false".

              2. If a leaf was single in the orginal quire or was
                 inserted as a single leaf, @single is "true".

              3. If one leaf of a conjoin is missing, @single is
                 "false" for both the missing and the remaining
                 conjoin.

              4. If a leaf is added as replacement for one half of a
                 conjoin, @single is "false" for both halves of the
                 conjoin.

             @mode = "original[=default]|added|replaced|missing";
                   default is "original" if @mode not provided
        -->
