  # Insert a placeholder join for +single+ in +leaves+.
  #
  # We find the place to insert the single's placeholder conjoin by
  # looking for a skip in the conjoin numbers.
  #
  # A regular quire is like this:
  #
  #   n=1 - join=8
  #   n=2 - join=7
  #   n=3 - join=6
  #   n=4 - join=5
  #   n=5 - join=4
  #   n=6 - join=3
  #   n=7 - join=2
  #   n=8 - join=1
  #
  # The join numbers move in steps of one from 8 to 1.
  #
  # When there is a single leaf, the joins will skip a number, at the
  # point where +single+'s join would be. Thus:
  #
  #   n=1 - join=7
  #   n=2 - join=
  #   n=3 - join=6
  #   n=4 - join=5
  #   n=5 - join=4
  #   n=6 - join=3
  #   n=7 - join=1
  #
  # The numbering skips a step from +join=1+ to +join=3+. We assume that
  # +n=2+ should have its placeholder between 1 and 3.  And thus we
  # insert the placeholder between n=6 and n=7.
  #
  # When the single leaf or a run of single leaves is at the end or
  # the beginning of the list there is no skip in the join counting:
  #
  #   n=1 - join=
  #   n=2 - join=
  #   n=3 - join=8
  #   n=4 - join=7
  #   n=5 - join=6
  #   n=6 - join=5
  #   n=7 - join=4
  #   n=8 - join=3
  #
  # In this case, we insert the placeholders at the end of the list.
  # The default insertion point is always 0. When searching for the
  # join position we start at the end or beginng of the list.  In this
  # case, where the single leaves are before the midpoint, we reverse
  # the list and start searching from +n=8 join=3+.  If the single
  # leaves were at the end of the list, we would begin searching at
  # beginning of the list.
  #
  # Because we reverse the list for a single toward the end of the
  # list, the default insertion point is always 0.  The insertions
  # occur in two steps:
  #
  # In the first pass, no skip is found so, the placeholder joined
  # to n=1 is inserted in the last position (that is the 0 position
  # in the list while it is reversed.
  #
  #   n=1 - join=
  #   n=2 - join=
  #   n=3 - join=8
  #   n=4 - join=7
  #   n=5 - join=6
  #   n=6 - join=5
  #   n=7 - join=4
  #   n=8 - join=3
  #   n=  - join=1
  #
  # In the second pass, the a skip is found between join=1 and
  # join=3 and the placeholder join for n=2 is inserted between the
  # last and next-to-last leaves:
  #
  #   n=1 - join=
  #   n=2 - join=
  #   n=3 - join=8
  #   n=4 - join=7
  #   n=5 - join=6
  #   n=6 - join=5
  #   n=7 - join=4
  #   n=8 - join=3
  #   n=  - join=2
  #   n=  - join=1
  #
  # If the single leaves are at the end of the list, as below, the
  # insertions occur differently.
  #
  #   n=1 - join=6
  #   n=2 - join=5
  #   n=3 - join=4
  #   n=4 - join=3
  #   n=5 - join=2
  #   n=6 - join=1
  #   n=7 - join=
  #   n=8 - join=
  #
  #  In the first pass, +n=7+ is handled. It is past the midpoint, so
  #  the list is not reversed. As no gap is found in the join
  #  numbering, the placeholder leaf is inserted a position +0+:
  #
  #   n=  - join=7
  #   n=1 - join=6
  #   n=2 - join=5
  #   n=3 - join=4
  #   n=4 - join=3
  #   n=5 - join=2
  #   n=6 - join=1
  #   n=7 - join=
  #   n=8 - join=
  #
  # When the second pass happens with +n=8+, no gap is found in the
  # numbering and the placeholder is again inserted at position +0+:
  #
  #   n=  - join=8
  #   n=  - join=7
  #   n=1 - join=6
  #   n=2 - join=5
  #   n=3 - join=4
  #   n=4 - join=3
  #   n=5 - join=2
  #   n=6 - join=1
  #   n=7 - join=
  #   n=8 - join=
